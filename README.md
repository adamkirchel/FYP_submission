# FYP_submission
Code for my final year project submission, to obtain an MEng in Mechanical Engineering. This project focuses on ML methods for the automation of the English Wheel

A) For the G-code interpreter to enable actuation of the English Wheel:

1) Open `G_code_generation' folder

2) To run app open 'WheelingProfileVisual.mlapp'. This will open MATLAB's app designer with the application ready to start. Press the 'play' button. The app is now running. For user features see the user documentation pdf.

Note: This is application is not yet complete. Further work is required for full implementation on the English Wheel.

B) For processing of data such as data orientation: 

1) Open 'data_processing' folder

2) Open 'Preprocess'. This holds different functions for preprocessing data.

C) For machine learning architecture:

1)
